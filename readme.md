# Xbox 360 SMC documentation project

360 SMC not well documented. Must document it well.

This is provided for people who want to get started on SMC hacking. However it will probably never be thorough, complete, or correct.

## Intended audiences

Everything here is written from a programmer's perspective, so the documentation is intended for the following people:

- libxenon users who want to program more stuff so we can finally make something on par with the OG Xbox BIOSes
- Emulator authors
- People who want to launch hardware attacks from or with the SMC (Winchester delenda est)
- Curious hackers

## Polite note to community members using this research

As with pretty much all the other Xbox 360 stuff I've done I can't guarantee that this is, or ever will be, complete or correct.
I have a million different projects going on and I have the attention span of a gnat so it's very likely that all progress on this
will suddenly halt while I chase after the latest shiny object I notice.

Keep these points in mind:
- Much of this research duplicates work by the community over the years. Be sure to confirm against existing
  material where possible.
- It's ultimately up to the community to decide what works and should be adopted. Peer review is a good thing.
